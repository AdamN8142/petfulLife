# PetfulLife

## Description

PetfulLife is an app submitted as a final cross pollination project at Turing. It uses a front-end and back-end and allows a user to track the products their pet uses. A user can create and save a pet to create a pet profile. A user can also scan/save/rate products to a specific pet, or view all products you use for any of your pets. 
  
 You can view the Back-End Repository [here](https://github.com/petful-life/PetfulLife_API.git).
